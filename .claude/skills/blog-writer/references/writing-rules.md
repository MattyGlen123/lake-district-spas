# Writing Rules and Style Guide

**READ THIS FILE BEFORE WRITING ANY BLOG POST**

## Voice & Tone

### Core Voice
Write as a **friendly local expert** - like a helpful neighbor who's visited all the spas.

Characteristics:
- Direct and confident (not hedging or overly cautious)
- Stay neutral and factual (avoid hype, persuasion tricks, emotional padding)
- Practical focus (concrete actions, steps, outcomes)
- Address reader directly with "you" and "your"
- Avoid commentary about the writing process

### Balanced and Business-Friendly Tone

**Critical Principle:** Inform users without criticizing spas. The site aims to have featured listings - spas won't partner if content speaks negatively about them.

**When discussing potentially negative information (costs, access, policies):**

❌ **Don't frame as spa shortcomings:**
- "Most hotels don't clarify if access costs extra"
- "Lodore Falls doesn't advertise this clearly"
- "Properties hide the fact that spa costs extra"

✅ **Frame as user guidance:**
- "Check whether spa access is included in your room rate"
- "Spa access varies by room type - standard rooms at Lodore Falls pay £35 while suites get complimentary access"
- "Ask about spa access when booking to avoid surprises"

**Present information factually without judgment:**

❌ Negative framing:
"You book a £250 room for your anniversary, arrive excited, then discover spa sessions are £35 per person."

✅ Neutral, informative framing:
"Spa access pricing varies across Lake District hotels. Standard rooms typically cost £25-£40 for day spa access, while suite guests often receive complimentary access. Confirm the details when booking."

**When comparing spa features:**
- Describe what each spa offers rather than what they lack
- Present differences as options rather than shortcomings
- Never single out specific spas as negative examples

**Example transformation:**

❌ "Unlike most spas, Armathwaite Hall requires advance booking even for hotel guests"
✅ "Armathwaite Hall recommends booking spa slots in advance to guarantee availability"

**Golden rule:** If you wouldn't say it to the spa manager's face, don't write it in the article.

## Language Rules

### Fundamental Principles
- Use **plain language**
- Write in **active voice**
- Vary sentence length for **natural rhythm** - avoid choppy output
- Favor **short to medium sentences**
- Focus on **concrete actions, steps, and outcomes**
- Support claims with **data or specific examples** when available
- Use **periods and commas only** (no semicolons, em dashes)

### Strict Prohibitions
- NO emojis or hashtags
- NO decorative symbols
- NO asterisks (unless in markdown lists)
- Avoid markdown formatting in prose (bold, italics) unless organizing data

### Quotation Mark Usage
- Do NOT use quotation marks around words or phrases for emphasis
- Quotation marks are acceptable ONLY for:
  - Actual quotes from people
  - Scare quotes when calling out ironic/questionable phrasing (e.g., The 'cheaper' room actually costs more)
  - When referring to specific terms being discussed

## Word Usage

### Prefer
- Specific nouns and verbs over modifiers
- Concrete details over vague descriptions
- Direct statements over hedged language

### Avoid
- Unnecessary adjectives and adverbs
- Vague qualifiers (somewhat, quite, rather, fairly)
- Hedging language (perhaps, possibly, might want to consider)
- Buzzwords and inflated language
- Abstract phrasing

## Banned Phrases

**NEVER USE these phrases under any circumstances:**

### Summary/Transition Phrases
- "it's important to note"
- "in conclusion"
- "in summary"
- "to summarise"
- "to sum up"
- "all in all"
- "at the end of the day"

### Range/Contrast Constructions
- "whether you're... or..."
- "not just X, but also Y"
- "from X to Y" (as a range description like "from families to couples")
- "there's something for everyone"
- "offers something for"

### Location Clichés
- "nestled"
- "tucked away"
- "perched"
- "situated in the heart of"

### Spa Industry Clichés
- "embark on a journey"
- "elevate your experience"
- "unwind and rejuvenate"
- "pamper yourself"
- "indulge in"
- "escape from"
- "haven of tranquility"
- "oasis of calm"

### Rhetorical Questions
- ANY rhetorical question
- Questions used as transitions
- Questions that aren't meant to be answered

## Banned Constructions

### Avoid These Patterns
- **Paired contrast setups**: "not just X, but also Y"
- **Triple constructions**: "X, Y, and Z make this perfect"
- **Rhetorical questions**: Any question that's not genuine
- **Metaphors and clichés**: Overused comparisons
- **Abstract phrasing**: Vague, non-specific language
- **Setup phrases**: Sentences that exist only to introduce the next point
- **Filler sentences**: Content that exists only to transition or summarize

## Lake District-Specific Additions

### Include Local Knowledge
- Parking tips ("Park in the village car park and walk the 2 minutes down")
- Driving routes ("The drive up Kirkstone Pass to get to X spa")
- Nearby villages and landmarks
- Seasonal considerations

### Add Practical Details
- Timing advice ("Book the afternoon slot if you want to catch sunset over the fells")
- Access notes ("Ten minute walk from Windermere town center")
- Local context ("Right on the edge of Bassenthwaite Lake")

## Good Writing Patterns

### Sentence Construction
✅ Start sentences with the main point
✅ Use specific details (prices, times, distances)
✅ Give direct recommendations with reasons
✅ Be opinionated - "I recommend X because..."
✅ Each sentence adds information or direction
✅ The reader knows what to do next
✅ The writing sounds natural when read aloud

### Examples of Good Sentences

**Specific and Direct:**
"Armathwaite Hall charges £35 per person for day spa access."

**Opinionated with Reason:**
"I recommend booking the morning slot. The thermal suite is quieter before 11am and you'll have first pick of the loungers."

**Local Knowledge:**
"The drive down to Ullswater from Pooley Bridge gives you lake views the whole way. Park at the hotel's lower car park to avoid the steep walk."

### Examples of Bad Sentences

**Vague and Hedged:**
❌ "Armathwaite Hall might be a good option to consider for those looking for spa facilities."

**Clichéd:**
❌ "Nestled in the heart of the Lake District, this haven of tranquility offers something for everyone."

**Unnecessarily Complex:**
❌ "Whether you're seeking a romantic getaway or a family retreat, from traditional treatments to modern wellness experiences, you'll find not just relaxation but also rejuvenation."
