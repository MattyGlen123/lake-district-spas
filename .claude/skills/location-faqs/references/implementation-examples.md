# Location FAQ Implementation Examples

This file will be populated with real implementation examples after the first location FAQ is completed. It will serve as the reference for all subsequent locations.

## Placeholder

Once the first location (e.g. Windermere) is complete, copy the full FAQ file here as Example 1, annotated with key patterns:

- Function signature with `Spa[]` parameter
- Finding specific spas within the array
- Extracting dynamic values using existing helpers
- Links pointing to spa detail pages (`/spa/{slug}#section`)
- Links to other location pages
- Aggregate comparisons across multiple spas
- Conditional rendering for optional spas
