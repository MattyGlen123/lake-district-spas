Lake Windermere stretches 10.5 miles through the heart of the Lake District, and three spas line its shores. Each occupies a different section of the lake with distinct facilities, pricing, and access policies. Your choice depends on whether you want outdoor infinity pools, family-friendly facilities, or a boutique lakeside retreat.

## The Three Windermere Spas

**[Low Wood Bay Spa](/spa/low-wood-bay-spa)** sits on the eastern shore near Ambleside, about a mile south of the town centre. The spa features two outdoor infinity pools with panoramic views across to the Langdale Pikes, six thermal experiences including an outdoor Fellside Sauna, and multiple outdoor hot tubs. This is the largest and most facility-rich option on the lake. The spa is 16+ only.

**[Lakeside Hotel & Spa](/spa/lakeside-hotel-spa)** occupies the southern tip of Windermere at Newby Bridge, roughly 8 miles south of Windermere town. The 17-metre heated pool looks out over the lake, and the outdoor spa garden includes a fire pit and heat domes for year-round alfresco relaxation. This is the only family-friendly spa on Windermere, with children welcome in the pool.

**[Beech Hill Hotel & Spa](/spa/beech-hill-hotel-spa)** sits on the quieter eastern shore between Windermere town and Newby Bridge, about 2 miles south of Bowness. The signature feature is an outdoor hot tub positioned on a lakeside terrace with direct Windermere views. The spa also has a Himalayan sauna, aromatic steam room, and 35ft indoor pool. A secret gate leads to two private jetties for open water swimming. The spa is 16+ only, though children can use the pool between 10am and 1pm.

## Spa Access: What You Need to Know

Access policies differ significantly between these three properties.

[Lakeside Hotel & Spa](/spa/lakeside-hotel-spa) and [Beech Hill Hotel & Spa](/spa/beech-hill-hotel-spa) include complimentary spa access for all hotel guests. Book a room and you can use the pool, sauna, steam room, and other facilities at no extra charge.

[Low Wood Bay Spa](/spa/low-wood-bay-spa) operates a tiered access model. Hotel guests get complimentary use of the Resort Leisure Area, indoor swimming pool, infrared sauna, jacuzzi, and steam room. The main spa experience, outdoor infinity pools, indoor infinity pool, fellside sauna, dry salt sauna, steam cabin, and herbal lounge, is a separate paid thermal journey. If you want the full outdoor and indoor thermal spa included without paying extra, Low Wood Bay is not the right fit, but if the leisure pool for a morning swim suits you and you plan to book a thermal journey anyway, it works out well.

## Day Pass Pricing

All three spas welcome non-residents with day passes, though prices and inclusions vary considerably.

**Budget option:** [Lakeside Hotel & Spa](/spa/lakeside-hotel-spa) offers the lowest entry point at £30 for their Steam and Swim package, giving you 3 hours of pool, sauna, steam room, and jacuzzi access. Their Twilight Swim & Steam is also £30 for 2 hours with a glass of fizz included.

**Mid-range:** [Beech Hill Hotel & Spa](/spa/beech-hill-hotel-spa) charges £45 for 3-hour spa access including the outdoor hot tub, Himalayan sauna, and steam room. Their Relax Spa Day at £115 adds a 25-minute Caudalie treatment and afternoon tea.

**Premium option:** [Low Wood Bay Spa](/spa/low-wood-bay-spa) starts at £60 for their Twilight Thermal Journey (2 hours, Monday to Thursday). Their Weekday Thermal Journey is £85 for 3 hours. The Recharge Spa Day at £175 includes a 50-minute treatment and lunch or afternoon tea.

For couples, Low Wood Bay offers The Hideaway Retreat at £600 for two (£300 per person), featuring a private treatment room with salt bath, 110-minute treatment, thermal access, prosecco, and dining.

## Which Spa Suits Your Visit

**Choose [Low Wood Bay Spa](/spa/low-wood-bay-spa) if:** You want extensive outdoor facilities. The two infinity pools and outdoor Fellside Sauna provide the most dramatic lake and fell views of any Windermere spa. The thermal journey includes six paid experiences giving you real variety throughout your visit. Best for dedicated spa days rather than a quick dip between activities, and note the Resort Leisure Area is available to hotel guests during restricted morning and evening hours at no extra cost.

**Choose [Lakeside Hotel & Spa](/spa/lakeside-hotel-spa) if:** You are visiting with children or want good value. The family-friendly pool and £30 day passes make this accessible for shorter visits. The outdoor spa garden with fire pit works well in cooler weather. The southern location also puts you closer to Cartmel and the Furness Peninsula.

**Choose [Beech Hill Hotel & Spa](/spa/beech-hill-hotel-spa) if:** You want a quieter, more intimate experience. The maximum 6-person limit keeps the spa peaceful. The outdoor hot tub on the lakeside terrace delivers direct Windermere views without the scale of Low Wood Bay. The Caudalie treatment range offers something different from the ESPA and Elemis products at the other two spas.

## Practical Tips

Parking is straightforward at all three properties, with on-site car parks for guests and day visitors.

From Windermere town or Bowness, Low Wood Bay is a 10-minute drive north along the A591. Beech Hill is closer, about 5 minutes south on the A592. Lakeside Hotel requires the longest drive at 20-25 minutes, heading south through Newby Bridge.

Pre-booking is essential at all three spas, particularly for weekend day passes and treatments. Beech Hill requires advance booking for any visit. Low Wood Bay and Lakeside accept same-day bookings when availability allows, but weekends fill quickly.

Bring flip flops to Low Wood Bay as they do not provide slippers. Robes and towels are included at all three spas.
