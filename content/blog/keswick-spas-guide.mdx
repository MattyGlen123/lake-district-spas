Keswick sits at the heart of the northern Lake District, surrounded by Derwentwater, Borrowdale, and Bassenthwaite. Two excellent spas operate within a 10-minute drive of the town centre, each offering a distinct experience for couples seeking relaxation after exploring the fells.

## Your Two Options Near Keswick

[Lodore Falls Hotel Spa](/spa/lodore-falls-spa) lies 4 miles south of Keswick in the Borrowdale valley. [Armathwaite Hall Hotel & Spa](/spa/armathwaite-hall-hotel-spa) sits 5 miles north on the shores of Bassenthwaite Lake, set within a 400-acre private deer park. Both are adults-only environments with 18+ age policies for spa facilities.

The drive from Keswick to Lodore Falls takes around 8 minutes along the B5289, passing Derwentwater on your left. Armathwaite Hall requires a 10-minute drive north on the A591, then west on the A66 before turning off towards Bassenthwaite Lake.

## Lodore Falls: Thermal Suite and Infinity Pool

The Falls Spa at Lodore Falls features nine thermal experiences arranged around an infinity-edge outdoor hydrotherapy pool overlooking Derwentwater and the surrounding fells. The thermal suite includes a Finnish sauna at 85°C with panoramic views, a herbal sauna at 65-75°C, a Roman laconium, plus salt and aroma steam rooms. An ice fountain and cold drench bucket provide contrast therapy between heat sessions.

The outdoor vitality pool incorporates underwater bubble loungers, a volcano fountain, and hydromassage neck jets. Book an evening time slot and you can watch sunset over the fells from the heated water.
