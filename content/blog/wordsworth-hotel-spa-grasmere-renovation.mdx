The Wordsworth Hotel in Grasmere closed in October 2024 for a multi-million-pound renovation by The Inn Collection Group. If you are searching for the spa, it is gone. The pool and spa facilities have been removed and replaced with additional bedrooms. The hotel is reopening as The Wordsworth Inn with 54 rooms, up from 38, but no wellness facilities.

This matters because the old W Spa at the Wordsworth had a pool, spa pool, sauna, gym, and Oxley's treatment rooms. Thousands of people still search for it each month. If you had your heart set on a Grasmere spa break, you will need to look elsewhere.

## Where to Go Instead: Swan Hotel Spa, Newby Bridge

[Swan Hotel Spa](/spa/swan-hotel-spa) sits on the River Leven at the southern tip of Lake Windermere, about 30 minutes south of Grasmere. The spa, called Holte Spa, opened with a full thermal circuit and treatment menu that fills the gap the Wordsworth left behind.

The standout feature is the swim-through hydrotherapy pool connecting indoor and outdoor bathing areas. The water is naturally filtered with minimal chlorine, and you can move between the heated indoor section and the open-air pool without getting out. Five thermal experiences run alongside the pool: an outdoor Finnish sauna with river views, an indoor Finnish sauna, a 100% humidity steam room, a cold plunge pool for contrast therapy, and multi-sensory experience showers with tropical rain, mist, and monsoon effects. A 12-seater jacuzzi pool rounds out the water facilities.

The treatment menu features [28 Temple Spa treatments](/spa/swan-hotel-spa#treatments), including pregnancy-safe massage and Gua Sha facial techniques. Spa hours run 10am to 4pm daily.

## Access and Pricing

Spa access at the Swan Hotel depends on your room type. Splendid rooms and above include complimentary spa access throughout your stay. Standard room guests and day visitors can purchase two-hour spa sessions separately. [Day passes](/spa/swan-hotel-spa#day-passes) are available to non-residents too, so you do not need to stay overnight to visit.

The spa is 18+, though 16 and 17 year olds can visit with a parent or guardian.

## Getting There from Grasmere

The drive from Grasmere to Newby Bridge takes around 30 minutes. Head south on the A591 through Ambleside and along the western shore of Windermere, then follow signs for Newby Bridge. The route passes through Ambleside and Windermere town, both worth a stop for lunch or a walk. Free parking is available at the hotel.

If you are combining a Grasmere visit with a spa day, the morning works well. Walk the Grasmere lakeside path or visit Dove Cottage, then drive down to the Swan for an afternoon spa session.

## Quick Comparison: What You Get at the Swan vs What the Wordsworth Had

The old Wordsworth spa offered a pool, spa pool, sauna, and gym with Oxley's treatment rooms. The Swan Hotel Spa goes further with five distinct thermal experiences, a swim-through hydrotherapy pool, cold plunge pool, and [28 Temple Spa treatments](/spa/swan-hotel-spa#treatments). The [thermal circuit](/spa/swan-hotel-spa#thermal) and contrast therapy options at the Swan are a step up from what the Wordsworth previously offered.
